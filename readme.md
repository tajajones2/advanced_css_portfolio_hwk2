 # Advanced CSS - Portfolio

This project will demonstarte building a portfolio page from scratch. 

A portfolio of my work will showcase a set of skills and talents while highlighting my strongest work as well as the thought process behind it. 

With this porject I learned how to effectivly apply flexboxes, media queries,
css varibles.

## Usage

- Navigation links are responsive
- UI scrolls to the corresponding section 
- UI scrolls to section with titled images of developer's application

- Apllication should deploy Live URL
